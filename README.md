## ðŸ“‹ SQL Queries

### Database Creation & Table Setup

```sql
-- Create Netflix table structure
CREATE TABLE netflix(  
    show_id VARCHAR(10),  
    type VARCHAR(10),  
    title VARCHAR(150),  
    director VARCHAR(250),  
    casts VARCHAR(1000),  
    country VARCHAR(150),  
    date_added VARCHAR(50),  
    release_year INT,  
    rating VARCHAR(10),  
    duration VARCHAR(15),  
    listed_in VARCHAR(150),  
    description VARCHAR(250)  
);
```

```sql
-- View all data from Netflix table
SELECT * FROM netflix;
```

## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

### 2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    rating
FROM (
    SELECT
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS total_rating,
        RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
) AS tl
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

### 3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT
    * 
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' and release_year = 2020;
```

### 4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT
    ltrim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS countries,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content,
    RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY ltrim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')))
LIMIT 5;
```

### 5. Identify the longest movie

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    MAX(duration_interval)
FROM (
    SELECT
        *,
        (duration || 'utes') :: INTERVAL AS duration_interval
    FROM netflix
    WHERE type = 'Movie'
) AS t1
WHERE duration_interval IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

### 6. Find content added in the last 5 years

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD - YY') AS new_date_added
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD - YY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 YEARS';
```

### 7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE director ILIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';
```

### 8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show' AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1) :: NUMERIC > 5;
```

### 9. Count the number of content items in each genre

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*),
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ', ')) AS genres
FROM netflix
GROUP BY UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ', '))
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

### 10. Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on Netflix

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'MONTH DD - YY')),
    COUNT(*),
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) * 100 AS yearly_avg
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY 1;
```

### 11. List all movies that are documentaries

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE listed_in ILIKE '%Documentaries%';
```

### 12. Find all content without a director

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE director IS NULL;
```

### 13. Find how many movies actor 'Salman Khan' appeared in last 10 years

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE casts ILIKE '%Salman Khan%' AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```

### 14. Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India

```sql
SELECT
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ', ')) AS total_actors,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 15. Categorize content based on keywords in description

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
        ELSE 'Good'
    END description_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```
