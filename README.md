Temporal Analysis

· Recent Content: Content added in the last 5 years
· Annual Releases: Movies released in specific years (e.g., 2020)
· Career Analysis: Actor appearances over time (e.g., Salman Khan in last 10 years)

Geographical Insights

· Top Countries: Top 5 countries with the most Netflix content
· Regional Content: Content release patterns in specific countries like India

Content Characteristics

· Duration Analysis: Identification of the longest movies
· Season Analysis: TV shows with more than 5 seasons
· Director Focus: Content by specific directors (e.g., Rajiv Chilaka)
· Genre Filtering: Documentary movies and specific content types

Advanced Analytics

· Actor Popularity: Top 10 actors in Indian-produced content
· Content Categorization: Classification based on content description keywords
· Missing Data: Identification of content without directors

🛠 Technical Features

· SQL Functions Used: Window functions, string manipulation, date conversion, aggregation
· Data Processing: Handling of array-like data in columns using UNNEST and STRING_TO_ARRAY
· Pattern Matching: ILIKE operations for flexible text searching
· Ranking & Filtering: Advanced ranking techniques to identify top performers

💡 Use Cases

This analysis can help:

· Content strategists understand platform composition
· Marketing teams identify popular genres and trends

📋 SQL Queries

1. Count the number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    rating
FROM (
    SELECT
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS total_rating,
        RANK () OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS ranking
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
) AS tl
WHERE ranking = 1;
```

3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT
    * 
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' and release_year = 2020;
```

4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT
    ltrim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ','))) AS countries,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content,
    RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY ltrim(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')))
LIMIT 5;
```

5. Identify the longest movie

```sql
SELECT
    type,
    MAX(duration_interval)
FROM (
    SELECT
        *,
        (duration || 'utes') :: INTERVAL AS duration_interval
    FROM netflix
    WHERE type = 'Movie'
) AS t1
WHERE duration_interval IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

6. Find content added in the last 5 years

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD - YY') AS new_date_added
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD - YY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 YEARS';
```

7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE director ILIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';
```

8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show' AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1) :: NUMERIC > 5;
```

9. Count the number of content items in each genre

```sql
SELECT
    COUNT(*),
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ', ')) AS genres
FROM netflix
GROUP BY UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ', '))
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

10. Find each year and the average numbers of content release in India on Netflix

```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'MONTH DD - YY')),
    COUNT(*),
    ROUND(COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) * 100 AS yearly_avg
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY 1;
```

11. List all movies that are documentaries

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE listed_in ILIKE '%Documentaries%';
```

12. Find all content without a director

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE director IS NULL;
```

13. Find how many movies actor 'Salman Khan' appeared in last 10 years

```sql
SELECT
    *
FROM netflix
WHERE casts ILIKE '%Salman Khan%' AND release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10;
```

14. Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India

```sql
SELECT
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ', ')) AS total_actors,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India%'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

15. Categorize content based on keywords in description

```sql
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN description ILIKE '%kill%' OR description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
        ELSE 'Good'
    END description_category,
    COUNT(*) AS total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1;
```
